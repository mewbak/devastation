One of the king's own knights finally struck him down; now he rests in the catacombs of the cathedral.With evil upon our land once more, I fear that the Skeleton King is again at work; building an undead army.  If you slay the evil king, he can not raise his army of skeleton warriors to destroy our land.You will find the king's tomb 3 levels below.|",

A caravan carried a piece of the sky rock to the royal capital for the King's wizards to study.  On the road north of here, they were ambushed by evil forces eminating from the cathedral.

If it is magical, it might be of some use to you!|",

Those who took up arms were slain or dragged away to become slaves - or worse. The church at the edge of town has been desecrated and is being used for dark rituals. The screams that echo in the night are inhuman, but some of our townsfolk may yet survive. Follow the path that lies between my tavern and the blacksmith shop to find the church and save who you can. Perhaps I can tell you more if we speak again. Good luck.|",
