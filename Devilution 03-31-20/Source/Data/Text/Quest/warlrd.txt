"I know of only one legend that speaks of such a warrior as you describe. His story is found within the ancient chronicles of the Sin War...\n \nStained by a thousand years of war, blood and death, the Warlord of Blood stands upon a mountain of his tattered victims. His dark blade screams a black curse to the living; a tortured invitation to any who would stand before this Executioner of Hell.\n \nIt is also written that although he was once a mortal who fought beside the Legion of Darkness during the Sin War, he lost his humanity to his insatiable hunger for blood. |"
